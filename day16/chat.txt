PART I:

Create a Chat UI that has at least the following:
- An area where the user can type in their name.
- An area where the chat messages are displayed, or the chat history area. Each chat message in the history area should include:
    - The chat message text
    - The chat message sender
    - The date/time when the chat message was sent
- An area to type in a new message to add to the conversation.
- A button to submit the new chat message and sender name. Don't worry about sending the date/time when the message was sent, as this will be handled by the backend.

At the start of the UI, the chat page should load in all the past messages into the chat history area.

When the button is clicked the UI should send in a JSON-encoded POST message: the name typed into the sender input and the new message text from the appropriate input.

The UI should refresh every X number of seconds. Play with the timing to find something that balances utility of the message history area and the message input areas. (The inputs are reset on refresh.)

Color, layout, style, theme is all up to you.


PART II:

Update your chat UI so that it only updates the chat history area every X number of seconds, instead of the whole page. This way the user can preserve what they may have been typing into the inputs while the history is getting updated.
