        // Exercise: Create a Rock - Paper - Scissors game with HTML / CSS / JS. The interface should:
        // - get input from the user, via form or buttons
        // - once the user selects their move, the computer needs to randomly select its move
        // - then determine who wins and displays the winner on the interface
        // - repeat this for at least 5 games, the winner being the best of 5, or sudden death thereafter. (If winner can not be determined after 5 games.)
        // - overall winner is then displayed, along with win / loss numbers
