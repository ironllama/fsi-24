Create a combo box mini-library:

- Remove all the HTML, CSS, and JS from the combo box / universities
   exercise into its own folder, so that it can be used with UI's other than
   the original universities exercise.
- You'll have to figure out what data and functions are needed at minimum
   for this new mini-library and provide an API for these, or a way to
   configure your combo box mini-library.
- Try to rerun your universities exercise with your mini-library to confirm
   everything still works. It should be indistinguishable to the user.
- As an added test, try using your new combo box mini-library with another
   small application. (eg. Cocktails API: https://www.thecocktaildb.com)
