# Find a fancy button online that you would like to serve with Flask.
# For example: https://codepen.io/ash_creator/pen/oNyNbNO
# Create a flask server with a route that will provide the page that
# shows this fancy looking button in the middle of the page, using a
# separate CSS file. Then add a JS file, as well, that will change the
# background color of the page to a random color with each button click.
